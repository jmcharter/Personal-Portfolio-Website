This is my personal project to develop and build a portfolio site for my Graphic Design work and Photography.

Having done almost no Web Design for over two years, and not being very up to par with it then, I am using this as a learning experience.

I have decided to go at this using the Jekyll blogging system to make my html pages more manageable. Alongside that I will be using SASS (Along with Bourbon, Neat, Bitters and Refills) to help with the styling of the website.
